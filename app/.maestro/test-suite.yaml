# Test Suite - Runs setup once, then executes all test steps
# This is more efficient than running setup for each individual test

# Run shared setup to reset database
- runFlow: setup-clean-database.yaml

# Now run all test flows in sequence
# Each test assumes a clean starting state from the setup above
# NOTE: Only include tests that don't call launchApp (suite-compatible tests)
- runFlow: create-episode.yaml

# TODO: Update these tests to work in suite mode (remove launchApp, update selectors):
# - start-end-episode.yaml
# - log-intensity-readings.yaml
# - add-log-medication.yaml
# - view-episode-details.yaml
