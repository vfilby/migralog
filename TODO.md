# MigraineTracker Feature Backlog

## Feature 1: Episode Intensity Graph with Medication Overlay
**Status:** Not Started

**Prompt:**
```
I need to create an interactive graph visualization for episode intensity data with medication timing overlays.

Requirements:
1. Display intensity readings over time as a line graph with smooth interpolation between data points
2. Overlay medication doses as markers/icons on the timeline showing when medications were taken
3. Support zooming and panning for episodes that span multiple hours/days
4. Use different colors or markers for preventative vs rescue medications
5. Show the medication name and dosage on tap/hover
6. Handle missing data points gracefully with appropriate interpolation
7. Support both light and dark themes
8. Add this as a new section in the EpisodeDetailScreen

Technical considerations:
- Use react-native-svg and react-native-chart-kit or victory-native for charting
- Load intensity readings and medication doses from the database for the episode
- Ensure performance is good even with many data points (100+ readings)
- Make the graph responsive to different screen sizes
```

## Feature 2: Comprehensive Test Coverage
**Status:** Not Started

**Prompt:**
```
I need to implement comprehensive test coverage for the MigraineTracker app including both UI and unit tests.

Requirements:
1. Set up Jest and React Native Testing Library for unit/integration tests
2. Set up Detox or Maestro for E2E UI testing
3. Achieve minimum 80% code coverage for:
   - Database repositories (episodeRepository, medicationRepository)
   - Zustand stores (episodeStore, medicationStore)
   - Utility functions (painScale, date formatting)
4. Create UI tests for critical user flows:
   - Starting and ending an episode
   - Logging intensity readings
   - Adding and logging medications
   - Viewing episode details
5. Set up CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions) to run tests on PR
6. Add test scripts to package.json
7. Create testing documentation in /docs/testing.md

Technical considerations:
- Mock expo-sqlite for unit tests
- Use test fixtures for consistent test data
- Follow testing best practices per .clinerules
- Test accessibility features
- Include snapshot tests for UI components
```

## Feature 3: Monthly Stats View (30-Day Calendar)
**Status:** Not Started

**Prompt:**
```
I need to create a new Monthly Stats screen showing a 30-day calendar view with migraine statistics.

Requirements:
1. Create a new screen accessible from the Analytics tab
2. Display a calendar grid showing the past 30 days
3. Show a heatmap overlay on calendar days indicating peak intensity (0-10 scale)
   - Use color gradients from green (no migraine) to red (severe 10/10)
4. Show summary statistics:
   - Total headache days in the period
   - Average peak intensity
   - Total medication doses taken (broken down by type: preventative vs rescue)
   - Longest streak without a migraine
5. Allow tapping a day to see episode details or navigate to episode detail screen
6. Support scrolling to view previous 30-day periods
7. Export functionality to share stats as an image or PDF

Technical considerations:
- Create a new MonthlyStatsScreen component
- Add database queries to efficiently fetch episode and medication data for date ranges
- Use react-native-calendars or custom calendar component
- Calculate statistics using date-fns for date manipulation
- Consider caching computed stats for performance
- Add navigation route to RootStackParamList
```

## Feature 4: Trend Analysis View (3-6 Month Moving Averages)
**Status:** Not Started

**Prompt:**
```
I need to create a Trend Analysis screen showing long-term patterns over 3-6 months using moving averages.

Requirements:
1. Create a new TrendAnalysisScreen accessible from Analytics tab
2. Display multiple trend line graphs:
   - Headache days per week (7-day moving average)
   - Average peak intensity per week
   - Medication usage per week (total doses)
   - Separate lines for preventative vs rescue medication usage
3. Allow toggling between 3-month and 6-month views
4. Show statistical insights:
   - Trend direction (improving/worsening/stable)
   - Correlation between medication usage and headache frequency
   - Month-over-month comparisons
5. Add ability to annotate the timeline with life events/changes (medication changes, etc.)
6. Export trend data as CSV or image

Technical considerations:
- Implement efficient database queries with date range filters and aggregations
- Calculate moving averages using a sliding window approach
- Use react-native-svg and charting library for line graphs
- Add data caching to avoid recalculating on every render
- Consider memory usage with large datasets (6 months of data)
- Create helper functions for statistical calculations
- Add to navigation stack under Analytics
```

## Feature 5: Improved Episode Timeline (Multi-Day Display)
**Status:** Not Started

**Prompt:**
```
I need to enhance the episode timeline view to better display episodes spanning multiple days with day separators.

Requirements:
1. Update EpisodeDetailScreen or create a new dedicated timeline view
2. For episodes spanning multiple days:
   - Show intensity readings grouped by day
   - Add visual day separators (date headers with icons)
   - Display date and day of week for each section
3. Show medication doses inline with the timeline at the time they were taken
4. Use icons/markers to differentiate:
   - Intensity readings (pain intensity icon)
   - Medications (pill icon, differentiate preventative/rescue with color)
   - Symptoms (appropriate icons)
   - Day boundaries (calendar icon or divider)
5. Add summary stats per day:
   - Peak intensity for that day
   - Total medications taken
   - Hours of relief
6. Ensure timeline scrolls smoothly and handles long episodes (72+ hours)
7. Support dark/light themes

Technical considerations:
- Load and group intensity readings by day using date-fns
- Create a custom timeline component with section headers
- Use FlatList or SectionList for performance with many items
- Calculate day boundaries from episode start/end times
- Add proper spacing and visual hierarchy for readability
- Consider adding timestamps to each entry
- Update the Episode type if needed to support timeline data structure
```

## General Development Guidelines

When implementing any of these features:
- Follow the existing code patterns and architecture
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Support both iOS and Android (test on both)
- Follow iOS-first design patterns per CLAUDE.md
- Update CLAUDE.md if adding significant architectural changes
- Create feature branches following the pattern: `feature/description`
- Write comprehensive commit messages
- Test thoroughly before merging to main
