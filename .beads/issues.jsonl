The code in dailyCheckinService.ts:33-44 is supposed to suppress the notification when episodeStore.currentEpisode exists, but this doesn't seem to be working correctly. Possible causes: 1) Race condition where currentEpisode isn't loaded when the check happens, 2) The notification is scheduled before the episode is created and not cancelled when episode starts, or 3) The handleDailyCheckinNotification handler isn't being called properly. Users shouldn't get 'How is your day?' prompts when they already have an active migraine logged.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-26T09:40:22.824333-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-26T09:55:36.578978-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-26T09:55:36.578978-08:00"}
