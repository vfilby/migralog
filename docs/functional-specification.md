# Pain Episode Tracking App - Functional Specification

## 1. Overview
A mobile/web application for tracking pain episodes, symptoms, and medication usage to help users identify patterns and optimize treatment strategies. Support both Android and iOS, but iOS is the primary use case and takes precendence.  

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Pain Episode Tracking
- **Episode Logging**
  - Start time (manual entry or real-time "start episode" button)
  - End time (manual entry or "end episode" button)
  - Pain intensity (0-10 scale, recorded at multiple points during episode, looking for well known pain scales used by headache doctors)
  - Pain location(s) (selectable body regions)
  - Pain quality (throbbing, sharp, dull, pressure, etc.)
  - Associated symptoms (nausea, visual disturbances, light/sound sensitivity, etc.)
  - Triggers (optional: stress, weather, food, sleep, etc.)
  - Notes (free text)

- **During-Episode Updates**
  - Ability to log pain intensity changes over time
  - Track when symptoms appear/resolve
  - Record medication taken during episode

### 2.2 Medication Tracking

**Preventative Medications**
- Daily/scheduled medication logging
- Custom medications with picture, schedule and default dosage (for example Advil is a 200mg tablet and the default dosage could be 3 tablets)

- Medication name, dosage, frequency
- Adherence tracking (taken/missed)
- Start/stop dates
- Effectiveness notes

**Rescue Medications**
- Quick-log interface during episodes
- Medication name, dosage, time taken
- Effectiveness rating (did it help? how much?)
- Time to relief
- Side effects

### 2.3 Symptom Evolution Tracking
- Timeline view showing symptom progression within episodes
- Intensity graphs over episode duration
- Symptom onset/offset times relative to episode start
- Medication timing overlay on symptom timeline

## 3. Data Analysis & Insights

### 3.1 Pattern Recognition
- Episode frequency (daily/weekly/monthly views)
- Average episode duration
- Most common triggers
- Time-of-day patterns
- Seasonal/weather correlations
- Medication effectiveness patterns

### 3.2 Reporting
- Summary reports for medical appointments
- Exportable data (PDF, CSV)
- Customizable date ranges
- Visual graphs and charts

### 3.3 Trends Over Time
- Pain intensity trends
- Episode frequency changes
- Medication effectiveness over time
- Symptom pattern evolution

## 4. User Interface Components

### 4.1 Dashboard
- Current status (in episode vs. pain-free)
- Days since last episode
- Quick-start episode button
- Quick-log medication button
- Weekly/monthly summary cards

### 4.2 Episode Log View

## 5. Data Model (Core Entities)

### 5.1 Episode
- ID, start_time, end_time
- Peak intensity, average intensity
- Locations[], symptoms[], triggers[]
- Medications taken during episode
- Notes

### 5.2 Intensity Reading
- Episode ID, timestamp, intensity (0-10)

### 5.3 Symptom Log
- Episode ID, symptom type, onset time, resolution time, severity

### 5.4 Medication
- Type (preventative/rescue)
- Name, dosage, frequency (if preventative)
- Effectiveness history

### 5.5 Medication Dose
- Medication ID, timestamp, effectiveness rating
- Episode ID (if rescue medication)
- Side effects

## 6. Key User Flows

### 6.1 Starting an Episode
1. User taps "Start Episode"
2. Log initial pain intensity and location
3. Select current symptoms
4. Optional: note potential triggers
5. App begins tracking duration

### 6.2 During Episode
1. Update pain intensity as it changes
2. Log rescue medications taken
3. Add new symptoms as they appear
4. Mark symptom resolution

### 6.3 Ending Episode
1. User taps "End Episode"
2. Log final pain intensity
3. Overall episode assessment
4. Medication effectiveness rating

### 6.4 Reviewing Patterns
1. Navigate to Analytics
2. Select date range
3. View frequency, duration, trigger analysis
4. Generate report for doctor

## 7. Technical Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: HIPAA compliance if storing health data
- **Offline Support**: Allow logging without internet connection
- **Sync**: Multi-device synchronization
- **Reminders**: Medication reminders, episode logging prompts
- **Backup**: Cloud backup of user data
- **Export**: Standard formats for medical records

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Weather API integration for trigger correlation
- Wearable device integration (sleep, stress tracking)
- Photo documentation (for visual symptoms)
- Shareable access for healthcare providers
- Machine learning for trigger prediction
- Integration with electronic health records
