## Issue #1: Database Encryption - Unencrypted Health Data Storage

**Priority:** 🔴 Critical
**Severity:** Critical
**Effort:** High
**Category:** Security, HIPAA Compliance, Privacy
**Labels:** `security`, `privacy`, `hipaa`, `data-protection`, `critical`

### Problem
The application stores sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI) in an unencrypted SQLite database, violating HIPAA privacy requirements and basic data protection principles. All health data including migraine episodes, medication usage, symptoms, and personal notes are stored as plain text.

### Evidence
- `src/database/db.ts` - Creates SQLite database without encryption
- Health data stored in plain text in SQLite files
- `src/services/backupService.ts` - Exports unencrypted backup files
- No key management or secure storage implementation
- Database accessible if device is compromised

### Impact
- **HIPAA compliance violations** - Legal liability for healthcare applications
- **Privacy breaches** if device is lost, stolen, or compromised
- **User trust erosion** - Users may not trust app with sensitive health data
- **Data exposure risk** - All historical health data accessible without authentication
- **Backup vulnerability** - Exported backups contain unencrypted PHI

### Recommended Solution

#### Phase 1 - Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. Implement SQLCipher encryption via expo-sqlite
   - Add expo-secure-store for encryption key management
   - Generate and store encryption key in device keychain
   - Migrate existing databases to encrypted format

2. Add device-level authentication
   - Implement PIN/biometric lock (expo-local-authentication)
   - Require authentication on app launch and after timeout
   - Lock app when backgrounded for privacy

3. Encrypt backup files
   - Add user-provided passphrase for backup encryption
   - Use AES-256 encryption for backup exports
   - Warn users to securely store backup passphrases

#### Phase 2 - Short-term (Month 1)
4. Implement secure key rotation
5. Add data sanitization before any logging
6. Create security audit trail

### Files Affected

## Issue #2: Production Console Logging - Information Disclosure Risk

**Status:** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE - Needs minor cleanup only
**Priority:** 🟢 Low (was High, but already implemented)
**Severity:** Low (was Medium)
**Effort:** Low (was Medium)
**Category:** Code Quality, Cleanup
**Labels:** `code-quality`, `logging`, `cleanup`

### Problem
**UPDATE:** The centralized logger service with `__DEV__` gates already exists and is working correctly. The architecture reviews referenced an older codebase state. Current status:
- ✅ `src/utils/logger.ts` - Properly gates all logging with `__DEV__`
- ✅ All production code uses logger service (only 2 files with console.*)
- ✅ E2E test console.log statements (256) are expected for test output
- ⚠️  One debug console.log in `src/services/toastService.ts` should use logger

Original concern was 321 console statements, but these are mostly in E2E tests where they're needed for test output.

### Evidence (Current State)
- ✅ `src/utils/logger.ts` - Centralized logger with `__DEV__` gates working
- ✅ Only 2 source files with console.* (logger.ts itself + toastService.ts)
- ✅ 256 console.* in E2E tests (appropriate for test output)
- ⚠️  `src/services/toastService.ts:13` - One debug log to clean up

### Remaining Work (Minimal)
- Replace the one console.log in toastService.ts with logger.debug()
- Optional: Add ESLint rule to prevent new console.* in src/ (excluding logger.ts)

### Recommended Solution

#### Phase 1 - Immediate (Week 1)
1. Create structured logging service with levels
   ```typescript
   // src/utils/logger.ts
   export const logger = {
     debug: __DEV__ ? console.log : () => {},
     info: __DEV__ ? console.log : () => {},
     warn: console.warn,
     error: console.error,
   };
   ```

2. Replace all console.* with logger.*
   - Use ESLint rule to prevent new console.* statements
   - Add pre-commit hook to enforce logging policy

3. Sanitize all logged data
   - Never log PHI (episode details, medications, symptoms)
   - Redact sensitive fields before logging
   - Use structured logging with safe fields only

#### Phase 2 - Short-term (Month 1)
4. Implement proper logging framework
   - Add log rotation and size limits
   - Implement remote logging for production errors (optional)
   - Add configurable log levels via environment config

### Files Affected
- **New:** `app/src/utils/logger.ts` - Centralized logger
- All files with console.* statements (64 files)
- `app/.eslintrc.js` - Add no-console rule
- `app/package.json` - Add pre-commit hook

### Success Criteria
- [ ] No console.* statements in production code
- [ ] All logging uses centralized logger service
- [ ] Debug/info logs disabled in production builds
- [ ] No PHI logged at any log level
- [ ] ESLint rule prevents new console.* statements
- [ ] Pre-commit hook enforces logging policy

## Issue #3: Database Schema Design - Missing Constraints and Validation

**Priority:** 🟡 High
**Severity:** Medium
**Effort:** High
**Category:** Data Integrity, Architecture, Database
**Labels:** `database`, `data-integrity`, `migrations`, `architecture`

### Problem
The database schema has design issues that compromise data integrity:
- ~~Missing foreign key constraints~~ (FIXED in current PR)
- Foreign keys enabled but missing in some relationships
- Inconsistent data types (TEXT for boolean values)
- Missing CHECK constraints for data validation beyond what's in schema
- Missing composite indexes for performance-critical queries
- No proper migration rollback support

### Evidence
- `src/database/schema.ts` - Schema definition with gaps
- Schema uses TEXT for boolean values instead of INTEGER CHECK(x IN (0,1))
- Missing composite indexes for common query patterns
- `src/database/migrations.ts` - No rollback functionality
- Some validation only in application layer, not database layer

### Impact
- **Data integrity issues** - Invalid data can be inserted
- **Poor query performance** - Missing indexes slow queries
- **Difficult schema evolution** - Hard to change schema safely
- **Potential data loss** - Migration failures without rollback
- **Application bugs** - Missing constraints allow invalid states

### Recommended Solution

#### Phase 1 - Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. **Note:** Foreign key constraints are NOW ENABLED (current PR)
   - Verify all foreign key relationships are correct
   - Test constraint enforcement

2. Add CHECK constraints for data validation
   ```sql
   -- Example: Ensure pain intensity in valid range
   CHECK(pain_intensity >= 0 AND pain_intensity <= 10)

   -- Example: Ensure episode end_time after start_time
   CHECK(end_time IS NULL OR end_time > start_time)
   ```

3. Add composite indexes for common queries
   ```sql
   -- Example: For episode queries by date range
   CREATE INDEX idx_episodes_date_range
   ON episodes(start_time, end_time);

   -- Example: For active medications
   CREATE INDEX idx_medications_active_type
   ON medications(active, type) WHERE active = 1;
   ```

#### Phase 2 - Short-term (Month 1)
4. Implement migration rollback support
   - Add down migrations for each schema change
   - Test rollback in CI pipeline
   - Document rollback procedures

**Priority:** 🟡 High
**Severity:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium
**Category:** Reliability, Error Handling, User Experience
**Labels:** `reliability`, `error-handling`, `user-experience`, `crash-recovery`

### Problem
The application lacks comprehensive React Error Boundaries and crash recovery mechanisms. When errors occur, users experience app crashes with no recovery options or helpful error messages. Current implementation has ErrorBoundary but it's not consistently applied throughout the navigation stack.

### Evidence
- Limited Error Boundary coverage in navigation stack
- Async operations lack comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Database errors may crash the app without recovery
- No graceful degradation for failed operations
- Users see cryptic error messages with no recovery path

### Impact
- **App crashes** instead of graceful error handling
- **Data loss** during error conditions
- **Poor user experience** with unclear error messages
- **Loss of user trust** from frequent crashes
- **Difficult debugging** without proper error context

### Recommended Solution

#### Phase 1 - Immediate (Week 1) - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
1. **Note:** Basic ErrorBoundary exists and ErrorRecoveryScreen implemented
   - Verify ErrorBoundary is applied at all screen levels
   - Add ErrorBoundary to navigation stack boundaries

2. Add comprehensive error handling in async operations

**Priority:** 🟡 High
**Severity:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium
**Category:** Performance, Battery Life, User Experience
**Labels:** `performance`, `caching`, `optimization`, `battery`

### Problem
Dashboard and other screens reload ALL data on EVERY focus without debouncing, caching, or TTL (time-to-live). This causes unnecessary database queries during rapid tab switches, excessive battery drain, and UI jank.

### Evidence
```typescript
// src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx:291-313
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    const loadData = async () => {
      await Promise.all([
        loadCurrentEpisode(),
        loadEpisodes(),
        loadMedications(),
      ]);
      // ... more loads
    };
    loadData(); // Runs on EVERY focus
  }, [])
);
```

### Impact
- **Unnecessary database queries** on rapid tab switches
- **Battery drain** from excessive disk I/O
- **UI jank** during data loading
- **Slower app experience** with loading delays
- **Poor UX** on lower-end devices

### Recommended Solution

#### Phase 1 - Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. Implement smart caching with TTL in Zustand stores
   ```typescript
   interface CachedData<T> {
     data: T;
     timestamp: number;
     ttl: number; // milliseconds
   }
   ```

2. Add debouncing for rapid focus events
   - Prevent refetch if data loaded within last 5 seconds
   - Use focus count to track rapid switches

3. Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern
   - Show cached data immediately
   - Refresh in background if stale
   - Update UI when fresh data arrives

#### Phase 2 - Short-term (Month 1)
4. Add optimistic updates
   - Update UI immediately on user actions
   - Sync to database in background
   - Rollback on failure

5. Implement loading states with skeleton screens
   - Show content placeholders during loading
   - Reduce perceived latency

6. Consider React Query or SWR library
   - Built-in caching and refetching
   - Automatic background updates
   - Request deduplication

- **Legal liability** in healthcare settings
- **No forensic evidence** for security incidents

### Recommended Solution

#### Phase 1 - Short-term (Month 1)
1. Create audit log table
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE audit_log (
     id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
     event_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- access, create, update, delete, export
     resource_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- episode, medication, etc.
     resource_id TEXT,
     action TEXT NOT NULL,
     metadata TEXT, -- JSON with additional context
     created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
   );
   ```

## Issue #8: Inconsistent State Management - Mixed Patterns

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium
**Severity:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium
**Category:** Architecture, Code Quality, Maintainability
**Labels:** `architecture`, `state-management`, `refactoring`, `code-quality`

### Problem
Mix of local state, Zustand stores, and direct database access creates complex state flow that's difficult to reason about. State is duplicated across component local state and Zustand stores, leading to synchronization issues and bugs.

### Evidence
```typescript
// src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx:224
const [todaysMedications, setTodaysMedications] = useState<TodaysMedication[]>([]);
// Local state duplicates data from Zustand store
```

Additional issues:
- Some components read directly from database
- Some components use Zustand stores
- Some components maintain local state copies
- Unclear which approach to use when

### Impact
- **State synchronization bugs**
- **Difficult to debug** state-related issues
- **Increased complexity** in components
- **Harder to test** with multiple state sources
- **Inconsistent patterns** across codebase

### Recommended Solution

#### Phase 1 - Short-term (Month 1-2)
1. Document state management patterns
   - Create architecture decision record
   - Define when to use local vs store state
   - Provide examples and templates

2. Standardize on Zustand for shared state
   - All data that persists across screens → Zustand
   - All calculated data → Zustand selectors
   - UI-specific ephemeral state → local useState

3. Refactor DashboardScreen as example
   - Move todaysMedications to Zustand store
   - Create selectors for calculated data
   - Use only local state for UI-only data

#### Phase 2 - Medium-term (Month 2-3)
4. Refactor other screens to follow pattern
   - MedicationsScreen
   - EpisodesScreen
   - SettingsScreen

5. Add ESLint rule to enforce patterns
